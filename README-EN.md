## What is this?

This is an SSH tool based on MCP (Model Context Protocol) that allows AI models to access and manage SSH connections through a standardized interface.

In simple terms, it enables AI assistants to perform various SSH operations, such as connecting to servers, executing commands, and managing files, without requiring users to manually input complex commands or switch to a terminal.

### 5. Configure SSH Connection

<details>
<summary><b>How to Configure SSH Connection</b> (click to expand)</summary>

1. In the Cursor editor, use the AI assistant to create a new SSH connection:
   ```
   Please help me create a new SSH connection to my server
   ```

2. The AI assistant will guide you to provide the following information:
   - Host address (IP or domain name)
   - Port number (default 22)
   - Username
   - Authentication method (password or key)
   - Other optional configurations (timeout, key path, etc.)

3. After the connection is created, you can test it with:
   ```
   Please help me test the SSH connection we just created
   ```
</details>

## Usage Examples

1. Check existing SSH connections
2. Execute the command and return results
3. Format output for better readability
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>tmux Session Management</b> (click to expand)</summary>

```

</details>

## Advanced Features

### Blocking Detection

SSH MCP tool includes intelligent blocking detection mechanisms:

- Automatic detection of interactive programs (like vim, nano)
- Identification of blocking background processes
- Configurable wait timeout (up to 10 minutes)
- Force execution option (using the force parameter)

### Compound Command Processing

Support for executing commands containing `&&` and `;`:

- Smart splitting and execution of multiple commands
- Maintains command execution order
- Provides detailed execution status
- Supports error handling and rollback

### tmux Integration

Complete tmux session management support:

- Create and manage persistent sessions
- Support for sending keystrokes
- Real-time session output capture
- Intelligent session state handling

## Enhanced Prompt Settings

To better use the SSH MCP tool for remote server collaboration, we recommend adding the following CursorRules setting to Cursor:

<details>
<summary><b>Recommended CursorRules Setting</b> (click to expand)</summary>

```
When handling SSH tasks that **need or might need user assistance**, create a tmux session (a shareable terminal session) and **directly tell the user** what command they can use to connect to the tmux session to collaborate with you (output this directly, not within MCP). Then begin your task.

**You must perform tasks within tmux. You can use tmux send-keys related commands, and MCP will automatically return the currently running command and the result of the previous command.**

You should check existing tmux windows before making a decision.

**Note: When running commands, you must patiently wait (using sleep commands) for the current command to complete, and not run the next task/command simultaneously/in the background/continuing.**

Unless explicitly requested by the user, you should not create help files, guides, or report files. Especially when the user is asking for your help, you should directly say what you need.
```

</details>

With this setting, the AI assistant will be able to handle SSH tasks more intelligently, especially in scenarios requiring user collaboration, by creating shared tmux sessions for more efficient and transparent remote operations.

## How It Works

<details>
<summary>Technical Implementation Details (click to expand)</summary>

This tool is based on the **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** standard, serving as a bridge between AI models and SSH services. It uses **node-ssh** as the underlying SSH client and **Zod** for request validation and type checking.

Main technical components include:
- **SSH Client**: Responsible for establishing and maintaining SSH connections, supporting password and key authentication
- **tmux Manager**: Handles the creation, management, and interaction with tmux sessions
- **Command Execution System**: Supports execution of single commands, compound commands, and provides blocking detection
- **Process Monitoring**: Real-time detection of process states to prevent session deadlocks
- **File Transfer**: Supports upload and download functionality, handling various file types

Each SSH operation is encapsulated as a standardized MCP tool, receiving structured parameters and returning formatted results. All remote commands are processed to ensure they are presented in a human-readable format, making it easy for AI models to understand command execution results.
